                <p>A major attraction of the town is the Wildpark Langenberg, a zoo in a largely undeveloped location on a wooded hill within the town of Langnau where animals such as the wolf, lynx and ibex can be watched roaming freely. Views of the Cantons Zurich and Zug and the Swiss Alps can be gained from the Hochwachtturm, a 33m tall wooden tower, accessible to the public, located on top of the Albis range about 1.5 km from the Albis pass. Near the town and overlooking Schnabell端cken pass are the ruins of Schnabelburg Castle, that was erected in 1150 to guard the road from Zurich to Lucerne (destroyed in 1309).</p>
